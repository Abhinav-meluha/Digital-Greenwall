#  Digital GreenWall – Gamified Eco-Interaction Companion App

##  Project Overview
Digital GreenWall is a gamified eco-interaction companion app designed to reconnect urban youth with nature through engaging, habit-forming digital experiences. The app transforms real-world environmental actions into fun challenges, rewards, and avatar growth, motivating students to adopt sustainable behaviors consistently.

This project was developed as part of the **Career-related Study (CRS) in Artificial Intelligence** under the course **Critical and Creative Thinking**, following a human-centered design and design thinking methodology.

##  Problem Statement
Urban students today spend a significant amount of time on digital devices, leading to environmental disengagement and reduced interaction with nature. Although awareness about environmental issues exists, students often lack motivation and consistency in taking eco-friendly actions.

**Digital GreenWall addresses this problem by using gamification and AI-inspired adaptive logic to make environmental responsibility fun, social, and rewarding rather than educational or guilt-driven.**

---

##  Target Users
- Urban school and college students (ages 14–18)
- Digitally active youth with limited outdoor engagement
- Students motivated by games, rewards, avatars, and social collaboration

---

##  Research Insights
User research and secondary studies revealed that:
- Students care about environmental sustainability but struggle with motivation
- Gamification increases participation and habit formation
- Visual progress indicators (avatars, streaks, rewards) significantly boost engagement

These insights directly influenced the design, feature selection, and interaction flow of Digital GreenWall.

##  Key Features

### 1️ Daily Eco-Challenges
Small, achievable daily eco-tasks such as watering plants, avoiding plastic, or observing local biodiversity. Challenges are categorized into easy, medium, and hard levels to ensure inclusivity and sustained motivation.

### 2️ Eco-Avatar Growth System
Each user is represented by a plant-based eco-avatar that grows from a seed into a sapling, tree, and eventually a green wall. Avatar growth is directly linked to eco-points earned through task completion, visually reinforcing positive behavior.

### 3️ AR Nature Viewer (Simulated)
A simulated augmented reality feature that visualizes virtual plant growth within the user’s environment. This strengthens emotional connection with nature while keeping the prototype technically feasible.

### 4️ Team Missions & Leaderboard
Students collaborate in teams to complete weekly eco-missions. The leaderboard emphasizes collective progress and motivational messages instead of individual ranking to reduce pressure and anxiety.

`

---

### 5️ Rewards & Recognition
Users unlock badges, avatars, and eco-themed rewards as they maintain streaks and complete challenges. Locked and unlocked states encourage long-term engagement and consistency.

##  AI Logic Simulation (Conceptual)
While no live AI model is implemented, Digital GreenWall simulates AI-driven personalization using rule-based logic inspired by behavioral design.

### Inputs:
- Task completion frequency
- Engagement consistency
- Time-of-day activity patterns

### Sample Logic:

IF user misses eco-tasks for 2 consecutive days  
→ Suggest easier challenges  

IF user completes 5 eco-actions  
→ Avatar evolves and reward unlocks  


This adaptive logic ensures fairness, inclusivity, and sustained motivation for all users.

---

##  Testing & Iteration
The prototype was tested with three peer users.

### Key Feedback:
- Avatar growth was highly motivating
- Competitive rankings caused mild anxiety
- AR simulation was engaging but needed clearer explanation

### Improvements Implemented:
- Shifted from individual ranking to team-based motivation
- Added onboarding tooltips for AR simulation
- Introduced challenge difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard)

##  Ethical Considerations
- No personal or location data is collected
- Offline or low-activity users are not penalized
- Gamification avoids pressure-based competition
- The app promotes positive behavioral change responsibly and ethically
